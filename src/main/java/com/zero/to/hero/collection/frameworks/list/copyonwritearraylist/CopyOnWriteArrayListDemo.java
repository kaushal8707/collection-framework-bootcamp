    /**    "Copy on Write" means that whenever a write operation
        like adding or removing an element
        Instead of directly modifying the existing list
        a new copy of the list is created, and the modification is applied to that copy
        this ensures that other threads reading the list while it's being modified are un-effected.

        Read Operations: Fast and Direct, since they happen on a stable list without interferance from modifications.

        Write Operations: A new Copy of the list is created for every modifications.
        The reference to the list is then updated so that subsequent reads
        use this new list.

                Example- while we have a notebook multiple students reading through note book but if
        anyone want to change the content so instead of changing in original notepad
        we will create a copy of notepad and ask them to modify on copies notepad
        and once he done i can use teh reference of list instaed of our list ref.

        usecase ( when less Write and more Read)

       When Read Operation is more compare to Write Operation then we should use CopyOnWriteArrayList

        because on every write a new copy of list is creating so more memory consumed.  */
